# SeniorCare Guardian

Healthcare technology prototype for senior-care monitoring, safety workflows, simulated health data and privacy/security demonstrations.

## What it demonstrates

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Interactive workflow views
- Environment-based configuration
- Simulation and demonstration workflows
- Privacy and security boundaries appropriate to a portfolio prototype

## Scope

The repository uses demonstration data. It is not a clinically validated alarm, monitoring or decision-support system and must not be used as a substitute for approved clinical equipment or procedures.

The repository is intended as inspectable engineering portfolio evidence. Claims about clinical effectiveness, regulatory compliance or production deployment are deliberately outside the project scope.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- npm

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

For features requiring an AI API, create a local `.env` file using the variables documented in `.env.example`. Never commit secrets.

Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

GitHub Actions runs the TypeScript and production-build checks on pushes and pull requests.

## Data protection

Use synthetic demonstration data only. Do not place patient names, national identity numbers, addresses, phone numbers, journal content, credentials or other confidential information in the repository or an unapproved deployment.
